<b>Abstract</b>: Rhodosporidium toruloides is an oleaginous yeast capable of producing a variety of biofuels and bioproducts from diverse carbon sources. Despite numerous studies showing its promise as a platform microorganism, little is known about its metabolism and physiology. In this work, we investigated the central carbon metabolism in R. toruloides IFO0880 using transcriptomics and metabolomics during growth on glucose, xylose, acetate, or soybean oil. These substrates were chosen because they can be derived from plants. Significant changes in gene expression and metabolite concentrations were observed during growth on these four substrates. We mapped these changes onto the governing metabolic pathways to better understand how R. toruloides reprograms its metabolism to enable growth on these substrates. One notable finding concerns xylose metabolism, where poor expression of xylulokinase induces a bypass leading to arabitol production. Collectively, these results further our understanding of central carbon metabolism in R. toruloides during growth on different substrates. They may also help guide the metabolic engineering and development of better models of metabolism for R. toruloides.
